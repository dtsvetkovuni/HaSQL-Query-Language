# HaSQL Query Language

The HaSQL is part of a PLC Coursework(Southampton Uni) 2021 of Dimitar Tsvetkov, Gerasim Tsonev(Gerasim2000) and Kaloyan Spirov.<br>

It was created using Haskell's Alex and Happy tools for parsering and lexing.<br>
Tested and working with GHC (Version 8.4.3) on Windows 10 and Linux.<br>

## [Introduction]
HaSQL is a conjunctive-filtering query language for CSV files allowing for programming freedom and the creation of a wide variety of queries. Its programs are written in CQL files and upon runtime, HaSQL supports theoutput of errors in the terminal. Theoverall design syntax of HaSQL is inspired by SQLite and Haskell.

## [Documentation]
You can read the documentation about the language from **HaSQL Documentation.pdf** inside the projects files.

## *Extra*
The **cql-hasql-syntax-highlighter** folder contains a Visual Studio Code highlighter extension for files used for HaSQL programming:<br>
